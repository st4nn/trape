People tracker on the Internet: Learn to track the world, to avoid being tracked.

Trape is a recognition tool that allows you to **track people**, the information you can get is very detailed. We want to teach the world through this, as large Internet companies could monitor you, obtaining information beyond your IP.

* Registration of victims, requests among other data are obtained in real time.
* If you get more information from a person behind a computer, you can generate a more direct and sophisticated attack. Trape was used at some point to track down criminals and know their **behavior**.
